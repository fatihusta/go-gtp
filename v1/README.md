# v1: GTPv1 in Golang

Package v1 provides the simple and painless handling of GTPv2-C protocol in pure Golang.

## Getting Started

This package is still under construction. The networking feature is only available for GTPv1-U. GTPv1-C feature would be available in the future.
See messages and ies directory for what you can do with the current implementation. 

### Creating a PDP Context as a client

_NOT IMPLEMENTED YET!_

### Waiting for a PDP Context to be created as a server

_NOT IMPLEMENTED YET!_

### Opening a U-Plane connection

Use `Dial()` or `ListenAndServe()` to retrieve `UPlaneConn`.The difference between the two functions is;

* `Dial()` sends Echo Request and returns `UPlaneConn` if it succeeds.

```go
// give local/remote net.Addr, restart counter, channel to let background process pass the errors.
uConn, err := v1.Dial(laddr, raddr, 0, errCh)
if err != nil {
    // ...
}
```

* `ListenAndServe()` just returns `UPlaneConn` without any validation.

```go
// give local net.Addr, restart counter, channel to let background process pass the errors.
uConn, err := v1.ListenAndServe(laddr, 0, errCh)
if err != nil {
    // ...
}
```

With `UPlaneConn`, you can `ReadFromGTP()` and `WriteToGTP()`, which gives you a easy handling of TEID and remote address.

* `ReadFromGTP()` reads from `UPlaneConn`, and returns the number of bytes copied into the given buffer(not including header), sender's net.Addr, incoming TEID set in GTP header, and error if occurred.

```go
buf := make([]byte, 1500)
n, raddr, teid, err := uConn.ReadFromGTP(buf)
if err != nil {
    // ...
}

fmt.Printf("%x", buf[:n]) // prints the payload encapsulated in the GTP header.
```

* `WriteToGTP()` writes the payload encapsulated with GTP header to the specified addr over `UPlaneConn`.

```go
// first return value is the number of bytes written.
if _, err := uConn.WriteToGTP(teid, payload, addr); err != nil {
    // ...
}
```

For SGSN/S-GW-ish nodes, this package provides a method to swap TEID and forward T-PDU packets efficiently.  
By using `*UPlaneConn.RelayTo()`, the connection automatically handles the T-PDU packet in background with the least cost.

```go
// this is the example for S-GW that completed establishing a session and ready to forward U-Plane packets.
s1uConn.RelayTo(s5uConn, s1usgwTEID, s5uBearer.OutgoingTEID(), s5uBearer.RemoteAddress())
s5uConn.RelayTo(s1uConn, s5usgwTEID, s1uBearer.OutgoingTEID(), s1uBearer.RemoteAddress())
```

_Note: _package v1 does provide encapsulation/decapsulation and some networking features, but it does not provide routing of the decapsulated packets, nor capturing IP layer and above on the specified interface. This is because such kind of operations cannot be done without platform-specific codes, But **netlink support is on its way**; stay tuned!_

## Supported Features

### Messages

The following Messages marked with "Yes" are currently available with their own useful constructors.

_Even there are some missing Messages, you can create any kind of Message by using `messages.NewGeneric()`._
